# PLSQL_Practice
This repository is for showing the projects I completed for my introduction to pl/sql class. It shows my progress in learning design considerations, syntax, and proper methods for creating and executing pl/sql. Feel free to use some of my scripts as practice references or study tools! I was using Oracle 12c during the duration of this class. It is a sample HR database using the Scott schema. The scripts for creating the scott schema and sanitizing/populating the HR databse are found in the Database_script folder. Project 2 is just a screenshot of my SQL Developer. There are also some notes in the form of PDF files I collected which I referenced here and there throughout the course in the SQL Notes folder. Have fun!
