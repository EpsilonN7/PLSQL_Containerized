Write a PL/SQL Anonymous block that uses a package, “ABC” to display information from the “emp” database table. 

The ABC package must contain the following public interface (i.e., package specification):

“DisplayEmpTop10SalariesInReverse” procedure
Call private procedure “BuildVarrays”
Creates a for loop to display the names & salaries VARARRAY in reverse order;
The ABC package body must contain the following private items:

A cursor that retrieves the top ten salaries from the emp table (i.e., must use ROWNUM pseudocolumn)
2 variable array types & corresponding variables to store the names and salaries for the 10 items retrieved from the cursor
A procedure BuildVarrays that uses a cursor for loop to create the “names” & “salaries” VARRAYS
Additional variable as needed to support the ”BuildVarrays” & “DisplayEmpTop10SalariesInReverse” procedures
Notes:

Use pseudocolumn "ROWNUMLinks to an external site." (refer to "Oracle 12c SQL Reference" documentation) to limit number of salaries to select to 10
FOR loop syntaxLinks to an external site.
Use describe command to determine the data type for the "ename" and "sal" fields of the "emp" table
